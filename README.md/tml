Earthquakeâ€“Tsunami Detection using Machine Learning ðŸŒŠðŸŒ‹

This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether an earthquake is likely to trigger a tsunami, based on seismic and environmental data. The goal is to explore AI-driven early disaster detection methods that can improve preparedness and response in vulnerable regions.

ðŸš€ Key Features

End-to-End Data Processing: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand patterns and correlations.

Modeling: Built and compared multiple ML models; Random Forest achieved the best performance (ROC-AUC = 0.96).

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC curve.

Notebook Design: Clean, professional notebooks with visualizations and plots.
